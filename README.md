# Dataset Research for capstone
  1. Enigma Weather Data (Currently taking far to long to import into active record, need to host from their site.)
  2. Enigma State Government Spending Data (Worked yesterday, lack of spending over time variable makes this a difficult dataset to visualize.)
  3. Enigma Census Data (Also got working yesterday, was able to visualize 5 tiers of income brackets for the 2016 census)
  4. vin.li CarBot Driving Data (worked beautifully, need a script to convert json output to csv format but integrated really well into scatter plot of RPM vs MPH of a single trip in Dallas.)
  5. gem 'rails-data-explorer' offers more functionality than chartkick

# Top Priorities
  1. Machine Learning class - This is a very high priority for me because it's something that I'm very interested in outside of my coding from class. This course has really stuck with me and I was able to use what I learned from it to land my own internship. I really enjoy the content and I feel like it's useful to expand my portfolio.

  2. Finish Rails Portfolio site - This is another strong contender on my list because it may be the first thing people look at when they look to possibly hire or interview me. I'm confident that building my own portfolio website and hosting it will showcase my drive as a potential employee as well as create a hub to introduce people to my other projects.

  3. Reboot Spotify App - I really enjoyed this project but felt that the tools I was given weren't quite cut out for the task. I would enjoy continuing to expand on this project to showcase my ability to deal with incredibly difficult API's and flesh out the user interface.

  4. Redo my Dad's website - This one is important to me because I would really enjoy working on a project for my family that already gets traffic from his fans. I want to create an easy to use app that my dad can use to integrate better with his fans and show off what I've learned from my time at Epicodus.

# Summary

Coming to Epicodus and making the decision to change careers was one of the best decisions I've made in recent years. If anything, I've learned that it is possible for me to discover and acquire a completely new skill if I choose to devote the resources I have to learning something new. It's difficult for me to admit that I don't know something or that I don't always have the right answers. Programming has helped me become more comfortable with being stumped and I look forward to the problem solving process and challenges of coding. This is a skill that I plan to continue to expand and take the time to discover new techniques, libraries, and resources. The coding community is incredibly growth oriented and I am eager to take the next step in becoming apart of it.
